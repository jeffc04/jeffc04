Hi, I'm Jeff 👋 Welcome to my Cybersecurity & IT Project Portfolio 🔐

I'm a tech professional passionate about securing digital environments and solving real-world security challenges. With several years of experience in IT and a growing foundation in security operations, I'm on a mission to transition into a Security Analyst role where I can actively hunt threats, respond to incidents, and protect systems.

📍 From vulnerability management using Tenable to building and monitoring a honeynet in Azure, each of these projects reflects my commitment to continuous learning and hands-on growth. Whether it's configuring a WAF in AWS, deploying EDR, or writing incident reports based on real attack traffic, I love diving deep into the evolving world of cybersecurity.
